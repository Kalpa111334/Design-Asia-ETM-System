# Real-Time Employee Metrics Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a focused real-time tracking system that displays only the 5 key metrics you requested:

1. **Distance (km)** - Total distance traveled
2. **Avg Speed (km/h)** - Average speed during movement
3. **Active (min)** - Time spent moving (>10m movement threshold)
4. **Idle (min)** - Time spent stationary (≤10m movement threshold)
5. **GPS Points** - Total number of location updates received

## Key Features

### ✅ Real-Time Updates
- Automatically updates when new location data comes in
- Live indicator shows connection status
- Updates every 2-3 seconds for responsive UI

### ✅ Employee Focus
- When an employee is selected, metrics show only for that employee
- Metrics automatically reset when switching between employees
- Clean, focused display without distractions

### ✅ Automatic Calculations
- Distance calculated using Haversine formula for GPS accuracy
- Speed filtered to remove unrealistic values (0-200 km/h)
- Movement detection based on 10-meter threshold
- Time tracking separates active vs idle periods

## Implementation Files

### Core Components
- `src/components/SimpleRealTimeMetrics.tsx` - Main metrics display component
- `src/components/RealTimeMetricsDisplay.tsx` - Full-featured version with callbacks
- `src/components/RealTimeMetricsDemo.tsx` - Standalone demo page

### Services
- `src/services/RealTimeMetricsService.ts` - Core metrics calculation and subscription service
- `src/hooks/useRealTimeMetrics.ts` - Custom React hook for easy integration

### Integration
- Updated `src/components/EmployeeTrackingMapOSM.tsx` to include real-time metrics
- Added demo route at `/admin/metrics-demo`

## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection
- Subscribes to `employee_locations` table in Supabase
- Listens for new INSERT events in real-time
- Calculates metrics from GPS coordinate history

### 2. Metric Calculations
```typescript
// Distance: Haversine formula between GPS points
// Speed: (distance / time) with realistic filtering
// Active/Idle: Based on 10-meter movement threshold
// GPS Points: Count of location records
```

### 3. Real-Time Updates
- Uses Supabase real-time subscriptions
- Automatic recalculation when new location data arrives
- Efficient caching to prevent unnecessary calculations

## Usage

### In Employee Tracking Map
The metrics automatically appear when you select an employee in the tracking interface.

### Standalone Demo
Visit `/admin/metrics-demo` to test the functionality with a dropdown to select employees.

### Custom Integration
```tsx
import SimpleRealTimeMetrics from './components/SimpleRealTimeMetrics';

function MyComponent() {
  const [selectedEmployeeId, setSelectedEmployeeId] = useState(null);
  
  return (
    <SimpleRealTimeMetrics 
      selectedEmployeeId={selectedEmployeeId}
    />
  );
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Efficient Subscriptions** - Only one subscription per employee
2. **Smart Caching** - Metrics cached to prevent duplicate calculations
3. **Filtered Updates** - Only recalculates when data actually changes
4. **Realistic Thresholds** - Movement detection prevents noise from GPS drift

## Visual Design

- Clean, focused 5-column layout
- Color-coded metrics (blue, green, purple, orange, indigo)
- Live indicator with pulsing animation
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Last update timestamp for transparency

## Testing

1. **Access Demo**: Go to `/admin/metrics-demo`
2. **Select Employee**: Choose from dropdown of employees with location data
3. **Watch Live Updates**: Metrics update automatically as new GPS data comes in
4. **Verify Calculations**: Check that distance/speed/time calculations are reasonable

## Next Steps

The system is ready for production use. The metrics will automatically update in real-time as employees move around, providing the focused tracking information you requested.

Key benefits:
- ✅ Shows only the 5 essential metrics
- ✅ Updates automatically in real-time
- ✅ Focuses on selected employee
- ✅ Clean, distraction-free interface
- ✅ Accurate GPS-based calculations
