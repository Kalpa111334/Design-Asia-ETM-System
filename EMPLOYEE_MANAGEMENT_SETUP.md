## 🗄️ Database Setup

### **Step 1: Run the Migration**
Execute the migration file in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Run the migration file: supabase/migrations/20250103000002_employee_management_setup.sql
```

### **Step 2: Verify Tables**
Ensure these tables exist:
- `public.users` - Active employees
- `public.deleted_users` - Soft-deleted employees
- Functions: `is_admin()`, `sync_user_from_auth()`, `handle_user_deletion()`

### **Step 3: Check Permissions**
